## Visualizations

For a lightweight visual tool I built (while leanring R's Shiny), check out [Canada_GDP](https://github.com/stevenwong15/Projects/tree/master/Visualizations/Canada_GDP). Contributions to Canada's GDP can be classified into 20 broad industry classes, each with a number of subclasses. The purpose of the visual tool is to compare the percent contribution to GDP between classes and subclasses.

A goal of mine is to learn how to make better graphics to help visual discovery, and story telling. The following is a growing list of visuals, from which I draw inspirations, and hopefully can learn. More to come ...
